# CS591HW3

Write-up files are Ziran_Min_writeup_part1.pdf and Ziran_Min_writeup_part2.pdf.

The code for second part is Ziran_Min_code_part2.ipynb.

######################################################

File Ziran_Min_code_part1_main.ipynb, is not the correct main code for part one. I recommend you to open Ziran_Min_code_part1_lr002.ipynb first because this is the right code for generating the output for question 2 with learning rate = 0.002 (it's in the compressed file or folder called part1_other_code).

######################################################


All other code files with name in format Ziran_Min_code_part1_xxx.ipynb have the almost the same content as the Ziran_Min_code_part1_lr002.ipynb. In each of them, I only modify the value learning rate or n_hidden for question 3 and 4. The reason of not using loops in one file is that training RNN takes long time and making one mistake in the loop will force me run everything again, so I compute every model and every graph in separate files.

You can run code on Jupyter Notebook.

You can go to my github https://github.com/ziranmin/CS591HW3, to have a better look of my code and write-up.
